## Project Title: Using Eulerian Video Magnification to enhance Medical Imaging

### Project Overview
The Medical Image Enhancement for Change Detection application is designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying subtle changes in medical images that may not be easily visible to the naked eye. This innovative application processes a series of medical images, such as MRIs, CT scans, and PET scans, taken over a period of time and enhances the differences between them. By highlighting these changes, the application aims to provide doctors with valuable insights that can aid in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

#### How to Use:
Coming Soon

#### Example Case
Consider a cancer patient who needs to undergo multiple scans to monitor the growth and changes in a tumor. The patient has scans taken at three different stages: pre-operation (pre-op), post-operation (post-op), and follow-up.

##### Pre-Operation (Pre-Op)
The patient undergoes an MRI scan to determine the size, location, and extent of the tumor before surgery. The application processes the MRI images to enhance the visibility of the tumor and provide a clear baseline for comparison.

##### Post-Operation (Post-Op)
After the surgery, the patient has another MRI scan to assess the success of the operation and check for any remaining tumor tissue. The application compares the pre-op and post-op images, highlighting any residual tumor tissue or changes in the surrounding area.

###### Follow-Up
During the follow-up period, the patient undergoes additional MRI scans to monitor for any recurrence or growth of the tumor. Our application analyzes the follow-up images and compares them with the pre-op and post-op images, detecting any new changes or growth that may indicate a recurrence.

By enhancing the differences between these scans, the application helps doctors detect subtle changes in the tumor that may not be visible to the naked eye. This allows for timely interventions and better treatment planning, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

### Benefits & Conclusion 
The Medical Image Enhancement for Change Detection application is a powerful tool that leverages advanced image processing and change detection techniques to assist doctors in identifying subtle changes in medical images. By providing enhanced visualizations the application aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis, ultimately leading to better patient care.
